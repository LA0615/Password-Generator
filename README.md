The user will click the GENERATE button and their pssword should appear in the textbox based on their input choices. 

- What was your motivation?
This project was created to practice what I learned during the javascript classes. 

- Why did you build this project? In order to understand functions, for loops, and conditional statements, this project was created so that I could practice these new skills. 

- What problem does it solve? This allows a user to select certain criteria for a password that will be generated for them upon request. 

- What did you learn? I learned that syntax is important in javascript and that variables must have a specific name in order to perform the required action.
